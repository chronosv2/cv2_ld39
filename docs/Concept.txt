Theme: Running out of Power

Robot exploring a facility -- Power is limited. Find batteries and larger capacitors to run longer. Shut down non-vital systems to extend power further.

Core Systems:
Capacitor: Stores 1000 power.
CPU: Draws 1 power per second.
Optical Sensors: Draws 1 power per second.
Auditory Sensors: Draw 1 power per second.
Arms: Customizable -- Socket different items into them.
  Cost 1 power per second base.
Shield Generator: Adds Damage Resistance. Costs 2 power per second. (Use 1 power per
  10 points recharge)
Treads: Allow movement. Cost 0 per second unless moving, which uses 5 per second.

So that means...
Stationary, all systems on:
1+1+1+1+2=6
1000/6=166 seconds of power.
When moving:
1+1+1+1+2+5=11
1000/11=90 seconds of power.

You can safely power off any system except CPU.
You can reduce power to Treads to cut power usage to 2 while cutting
  movement speed by 60%.
